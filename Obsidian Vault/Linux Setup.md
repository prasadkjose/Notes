## My Linux Setup Guide

This guide outlines the steps I took to set up my current Linux environment.

---

### 1. Operating System Installation

#### 1.1. Distribution Choice

*   **Distribution:** Kubuntu
*   **Reasoning:** It's a really good UI and customizable themes. 

#### 1.2. Installation Process

1.  **Download ISO:** Download the latest stable Kubuntu ISO from the official website.
2.  **Create Bootable USB:** Use a tool like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) or [Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) to create a bootable USB drive.
3.  **Boot from USB:** Restart your computer on BIOS/UEFI and boot from the USB drive.

### 2. Post-Installation Configuration

#### 2.1 Essential Software Installation
*Note: Check the packages int he setup script first* 

``` bash
chmod +x setup_linux.sh
sudo ./setup_linux.sh
```

1. Install Obisidian from their website
#### 2.3. Customization

*   **Theme:** [Dream-dark-color-global-5]

### 3. Development Environment Setup

#### 3.1. Version Control

```bash
git config --global user.name "prasad koshy jose"
git config --global user.email "prasadkjose@gmail.com"
```

#### 3.2. Encryption of Repository File and Folders
##### Git-Crypt Quick Setup (Linux)

##### Install
```bash
sudo apt install git-crypt
```

##### Initialize in Your Repo
```bash
cd your-repo
git-crypt init
```
##### Select Which Files to Encrypt
Create a file named `.gitattributes` in your repo root:

```bash
# .gitattributes
secrets/* filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
.env filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
```
##### Add and Commit
```bash
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Set up git-crypt encryption"
```
##### Verify Encryption
```bash
git-crypt status
```

To check that encryption works, clone the repo fresh â€” encrypted files will appear as binary gibberish to unauthorized users.
##### Unlock Repo (After Cloning)
Once someone has access:

```bash
git-crypt unlock
```

---

#### New Computer?
##### 1. Download the Private and Public Keys from Proton
##### 1.1 Import the Keys

```
gpg --import public.asc
gpg --import secret.asc 
```
##### 1.2 Verify
`gpg --list-secret-keys`

##### 1.3 Unlock the Repo from above

### 4. Additional Tools and Tweaks

#### 4.1. Terminal Enhancements

I am yet to find a better terminal than Konsole
#### 4.2. System Monitoring and Power Essentials

*   Sleep is disabled everywhere since in Surface devices there are ACPI issues .
* Disable sleep
`sudo systemctl mask sleep.target suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target`

* Enable sleep again
`sudo systemctl unmask sleep.target suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target`
#### 4.3.
